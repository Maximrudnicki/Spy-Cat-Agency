# Spy Cat Agency by Maxim Rudnitskiy

## How to start

##### Make sure that you cloned the project: git clone https://github.com/Maximrudnicki/Spy-Cat-Agency.git

##### In order to start the app you need to enter the following command: docker-compose up -d

##### Once containers are up, just visit localhos:8000 or check the postman here: https://www.postman.com/navigation-engineer-62741940/workspace/rudnytskyi-test/collection/25383927-2ea6fdcf-a203-4ca9-b2c9-f09eb1bbb83b?action=share&creator=25383927

##### Keep in mind that you need to be signed in in Postman and create a fork before using the application

##### If you need to stop the app, just enter docker-compose down

##### I used Gin and GORM to build the app.
