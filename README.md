# Spy Cat Agency by Maxim Rudnitskiy

## How to start

##### Make sure that you cloned the project: git clone https://github.com/Maximrudnicki/Spy-Cat-Agency.git 

##### In order to start the app you need to enter the following command: cd Spy-Cat-Agency 
##### And then this one: docker-compose up -d

##### Once containers are up, just visit localhost:8000 or check the postman here: https://www.postman.com/navigation-engineer-62741940/workspace/sca

##### Also, if the app is not started or simply doesn't work, just try to start it again using docker desktop. The issue can appear in case the app starts before the database. Once the DB is up you can start container with the app itself

##### Keep in mind that you need to be signed in in Postman and create a fork before using the application

##### If you need to stop the app, just enter docker-compose down

##### I used Gin and GORM to build the app.
